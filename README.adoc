= restutil

A cross-platform REST library that transpiles from Java to Javascript (via GWT) and to Objective-C (via j2objc).


== About

One of the biggest problems with developing apps for multiple platforms if you don't want to rely on Javascript 
based frameworks is that you need to have multiple teams develop the same code for each platform - and for each version of your app.

Google uses this approach: They develop the logic and backend communication part of the app once in Java and then use 
it for Android, IOS and Web/Javascript. So only the UI Layer needs to be developed every time.
 
This way you can keep all of the knowledge about security token handling, caching, validation etc. in your Java team and 
reduce the amount of code that needs to be developed and tested dramatically.

== Now, why the restutil?

restutil is a thin layer on top of standard native REST frameworks which allows us to make REST calls from our transpiled Java code. 

**Obviously, the REST communication alone is not enough** - you could use any native REST frameworks directly. But if you want
to implement logic in Java that does the API calls plus token handling, validation etc. then you need a Java implementation to make these calls.
   
The Android implementation 
https://github.com/markhofmann/restutil/android/src/main/java/com/rockstar/restutil/android/AndroidRestRequest.java[AndroidRestRequest.java] 
uses Volley, the GWT implementation
https://github.com/markhofmann/restutil/gwt/src/main/java/com/rockstar/restutil/gwt/GwtRestRequest.java[GWTRestRequest.java]
(.java) uses the GwtRequestBuilder.

The IOS implementation 
https://github.com/markhofmann/restutil/ios/src/main/java/com/rockstar/restutil/ios/IOSRestRequest.java[IOSRestRequest.java]
uses Unirest.


== Building the project

=== Building the IOS library

When building for the first time, you might need to install cocoapods.

NOTE: j2objc is not compatible with cocoapods 1.x, version 0.39.0 works for me.

1. check for your version
** pod --version
1. uninstall cocoapods
** sudo gem uninstall cocoapods
1. install version 0.39.0
** sudo gem install cocoapods -v 0.39.0


1. Install the latest j2objc release
** https://github.com/google/j2objc/releases
1. cd into the root directory of restutil
1. cp example/iosjava/local.properties.example example/iosjava/local.properties
1. set your j2objc install dir in local.properties
1. ./build_ios.sh
** NOTE: whenever you changed the java code, it's necessary to run this command again which convert java codes to Objective C and then pack it in a static library which the iOS project imports.

  

 
==== Testing the client

After building successfully, the objectivec library contains a class called "IOSRestUtilTest" containing a "testGet" method.

Simply import the library and invoke the "testGet" method. It should run a GET request on https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1 and print the response to system out. 

==== Using the generated code

The build should be configured as an ios static library project

NOTE: open the '.xcworkspace' file in Xcode. It will fail if you open the '.xcodeproj' file.

NOTE: when working with Swift, setup your bridging header:
